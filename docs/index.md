# Issie Documentation Home

See [Getting Started](gettingStarted.html) for how to put Issie on your laptop or develop Issie.

See [User Tutorial](userGuide.html) for a useful introduction to Issie on one page which you can follow or read.

See [Parameter System](parameterSystem.html) for a detailed explanation of symbolic parameters, expressions, constraints, and simulation integration.

## What is ISSIE?

* ISSIE is an **easy-to-use schematic editor and simulator** for hierarchical design of **digital logic circuits**. Run it and see the built-in demos for what it can do! ISSIE is targeted at 1st year university students, but would be useful teaching in schools and even for quick hardware design and test in an industrial or research environment. For the latter use case although we allow Verilog input and output these features need a bit more work to be as complete and nice as the rest of ISSIE.
* ISSIE was motivated because we found that industry-standard CAD systems were too complex and buggy to be learnt in labs, and when learnt still nasty to use. Other educational products were too limited. We wanted a system to teach hierarchical design and digital electronics visually that would scale to large designs.
   - We find that EEE-educated internal PhD candidates starting with schematic logic designs usually have a better understanding of what **digital hardware is** than those from other institutions starting with HDL.
* ISSIE has as a design principle that it should be easy to use by a novice, with all errors well highlighted. Error messages telling the user what the error is and how precisely to correct it, so a novice user can make the correction. Keeping to this principle has been challenging but worthwhile. We also wanted a complete system capable of real design work: good user interface is separate from large-scale features and performance and there is no reason they cannot both be implemented.
* ISSIE is developed **by undergraduate students and staff at Imperial College London**. The code is cross-platform and binaries are released for Windows and Silicon (Arm64) Mac and Linux platforms.
* ISSIE is implemented using nearly 50K lines in the Functional-first language F#, the equivalent of 150K lines in a typical OOP language. ISSIE's implementation is (almost) pure functional programming without assignment. This makes the codebase very maintainable! ISSIE has **its own digital simulator**, which uses **write-once semantics** on mutable (JS typed) arrays to combine the robustness of functional programming with high performance.
* ISSIE uses the [FABLE F# to Javascript compiler](https://fable.io/), [Elmish MVU framework](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/), and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). This tool chain creates seamless cross-platform applications with simple and highly productive coding.
* ISSIE can generate Verilog output to drive FPGAs and has an integrated system to do this directly using **ISSIE-Stick** hardware.
* ISSIE can also accept Verilog source, using this to define and simulate equivalent schematic components.
* For acronym geeks, ISSIE stands for: *Interactive Schematic Simulator with Integrated Editor*.

## ISSIE Development Roadmap

#### 2024 
* Workaround unexpected & undocumented React 17 memory leak
* Better user interface to Waveform Simulator
* Longer simulation times keeping waveforms in memory
* Automatic whole-circuit wire segment separation for almost perfect auto-routing

#### 2025

* New Waveform Selector for waveform simulations (complete)
* Tooltips on waveform simulator waveforms (complete)
* Symbolic parameters to make component bit-widths etc adjustable (in progress)
* Improvements to Verilog parser and to-Issie synthesis (in progress)
* See [Issue 506](https://github.com/tomcl/issie/issues/506) for possible other changes.
